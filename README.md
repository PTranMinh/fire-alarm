# Smart gas alarm 
The intelligent fire alarm system is a modern solution that uses advanced technology to detect and warn of fires quickly and accurately. The system also incorporates the function of displaying temperature and humidity. This will be a comprehensive solution for certain cases.
# Component
This system uses KIT microcontroller, DHT11 sensor to measure humidity and 7-segment LED to display time, MQ2 gas sensor to detect gas.
# About PIC KIT V2
You must have a dedicated PIC software to simulate and a programmer for the PIC microcontroller. You can find it at an electronics store.
